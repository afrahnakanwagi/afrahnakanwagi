### 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate Software Developer and UI/UX Designer based in Kampala, Uganda. With over a year of experience, I craft user-centric, responsive, and innovative digital solutions that blend technical expertise with creative design.  
My mission is to build seamless, impactful applications that solve real-world problems.

> 💡 **Fun Fact**: I once designed an entire Agro-Tourism website in Figma in just 48 hours to meet a tight deadline — and the client loved it!
